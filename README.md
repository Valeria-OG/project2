### What is Dog Home?
##### Dog Home is an application inspired by the love and respect we have for dogs, the concept of this app is to find a loving family for street dogs by giving them for adoption. This app will not only help dogs have a better life but it will also help to clean the streets from dogs in bad conditions and this will also make streets more secure.
#### This app is intended to make adoption easy and fast.
#### This app will not only help you adopt but also give dogs for adoption.

### Motivation
#### In Mexico, it is estimated that there are 28 million dogs of which 70% live on the street, this number grows 20% each year.
#### Mexico is the country with the most street dogs in Latin America.
#### We know how big this problem is in our country which is why we wanted to come with a solution for this issue.
#### ALL ANIMALS DISERVE A FAMILY
